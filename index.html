            <h5>A funny story</h5>
            <div class="story">
              <p>I was on the bus and an old man stood in front of me. I noticed he looked at me too much and even laughed sometimes. After a while there was more space in the bus so he came closer and told me that I looked like Columbo (I was wearing a beige trench coat, same as on the picture) and that‚Äôs why he was laughing. He started saying Columbo catchwords and I didn‚Äôt understand anything because I never watched this tv show. He noticed I was a little embarrassed so he just left and got out of the bus. I guess I‚Äôll never wear that trench again‚Ä¶</p>
